    ## Document Genie: Get instant insights from your Documents

    This chatbot is built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, leveraging Databricks's DBRX-instruct and gpt4all embeddings. It processes uploaded PDF documents by breaking them down into manageable chunks, creates a searchable vector store, and generates accurate answers to user queries. This advanced approach ensures high-quality, contextually relevant responses for an efficient and effective user experience.

    ### How It Works

    Follow these simple steps to interact with the chatbot:

    1. **Upload Your Documents**: The system accepts multiple PDF files at once, analyzing the content to provide comprehensive insights.

    2. **Ask a Question**: After processing the documents, ask any question related to the content of your uploaded documents for a precise answer.
